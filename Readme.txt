This is a bash script that scans the bitcoin folder on your local linux machine and moves the majority of the blk and rev files to an external hard drive. This reduces the burden on your local machine from ~300Gb to ~4Gb. You could move the entire bitcoin folder, but I have found this increases the startup time for Bitcoin Core.

For this to work, you need a linux machine, Bitcoin Core installed, and an external hard drive (I recommend 1Tb).
